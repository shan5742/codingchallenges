# Coding Challenges

Repo of coding challenges completed by myself. This will include all challenges with my solutions given and act as a log for myself and others to track my progress.

### Expectation

I am aiming to update this log daily, with multiple challenges, if not daily then at least 5x per week. This may become more difficult as my other work increases and becoming better at JavaScript becomes less of a priority other learning another technology for example. Having said all that vanilla JavaScript is a core skill and one which I will need to practice for as long as I am in the industry and this will act as a good place to track that progress.

### Sorting

Right now this repo just displays a list of files with the challenge name as the title, which is fine for now, but if I stick to this log and update as often as planned it will soon become a big list and painful to sift through, so I will likely organise the list in some way.
